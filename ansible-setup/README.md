# Ansible Setup

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is:
- Something to work on at my leisure without any deadlines
- Learn [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) so I can automate the things
- Copy the hard work of others
- Lessen the setup time when I decide to wipe my system and start over

## TODO
- [x] Use homebrew to install my "necessary" applications
- [ ] Finish todo
